# automation
some cool automation scripts
Organizer.py
  This script helps you organize unordered stuffs.
  You may have a directory full of files hanging here and there, and would want to segregate.
  But end up messing it further.
  Run this script with the messy folder as input.
  This separates the files and puts them into folders named on the extension of the file.
  
  Ex :
    Before running the Script
      |- root
          |- .
          |- ..
          |- a.txt
          |- b.html
          |- c.mp3
          |- d.mp4
          |- x.txt
          |- y.mp4
        
    After running the script
      |-root
          |- .
          |- ..
          |- html
              |- b.html
          |- mp3
              |- c.mp3
          |- mp4
              |- d.mp4
              |- y.mp4
          |- txt
              |- a.txt
              |- x.txt

  Looks way more organized?
  Job Done.
